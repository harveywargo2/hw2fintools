# Three Investment Categories
### Notable
Category 1: Investments denominated in a currency.
> Buffett pulled out his wallet, took out a one dollar bill and read out loud, “In God We Trust.” He noted this is false advertising. What it should say is, “In Government We Trust.” God isn’t going to do anything about that dollar.

Category 2: Investments that don’t produce anything but you hope to sell at a higher price.
> Gold, for example. Buffett reprised his gold thought experiment, where if you took all the gold in the world, you could make a 67-foot cube weighing 175,000 metric tons. You could then get a ladder and sit on top of it, fondle it, polish it. But that cube isn’t going to do anything.

> He cited Keynes Chapter 12 – “The State of Long Term Expectation” from The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money – that such investing amounts to a beauty contest where you are betting not on whom you believe to be the prettiest contestant, but who others will believe is beautiful. The self-effacing Buffett reminded us that he tried to do that with silver and proved to be 13 years too early.

Category 3: Investments in assets that produce something.
> For example, with a farm, one can make a rational calculation on its value. Success will be determined on cash produced. You don’t care about the quote the next day or month. You are looking to the business for your return. This is the basis for Berkshire’s investments in ISCAR and Lubrizol.
