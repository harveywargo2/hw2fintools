# Dividends Still Don't Lie

#### General Book Notes
Concept - Speculation (p. 13)
> They are speculators. 
> Speculators hope that the price of a stock will go up and reward them with profits. 
> Investors know that stocks that pay dividends go up too. 
> Meanwhile, they are getting a return on their capital. 
> They believe the old adage: A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
 
Disciplined Investing (p. 159)
> Investors also don’t have to be particularly talented, but they do have to be disciplined. 
> At the end of the day, if you work hard and are smart enough to save money, then you are entirely capable of managing it.




Investing Goals (p. 25)
> If you know what your goals and objectives are, you are well on your way to achieving investment success. 
> At the end of the day, successful investing is realized by three activities: 
> 1. know the end goal(s) of why you are investing; 
> 2. use an investment approach that makes sense to you and can generate returns sufficient to meet your goals; 
> 3. and, keep an eye on taxes and expenses.


Future Cash Needs (p. 32)
> Once you have the end in mind there is only one thing you need to understand about investing: 
> The sole purpose of investing is to grow your capital and income base to meet a current or future cash need.


#### Income Strategy
Income Generation (p. 23)
**Generating sufficient cash to meet your needs will be a primary objective until you die.** 
> If you have loved ones you are responsible for, they will continue to need cash after you die. 
> During the employment years, you must make wages, salaries, and bonuses do double duty, providing for current needs while investing for the future. 
> Optimally, the invested cash will generate sufficient interest, dividends, and capital appreciation to meet your future needs when your wages, salaries, and bonuses are no longer your primary sources of income. 
> Your long-term challenge then will be to balance your cash flow between your current cash needs and your need to accumulate cash for the future. 
> Your level of success in this endeavor can be positively impacted by a modicum of financial planning.


#### Dividend Yield Theory

Dividend Valuation (p. 29)
> According to the Dividend-Yield Theory, the price of a stock is driven by its yield.


Dividend Yield To Predict Stock Value (p. 51)
> The underlying premise of the dividend-value strategy is that the dividend yield is the major driver for the price of a stock.

Overvalued vs Undervalued (p. 62)
> As a general rule, a stock is overvalued when it has a relatively high price and a low dividend yield. 
> It is undervalued when it has a relatively low price and a high dividend yield.


Dividend Value Depends On Company Norms (p. 125)
> Some stocks are undervalued when their yields are 4 percent, 5 percent, or 6 percent. 
> Others may be equally undervalued on the basis of their historic profiles of dividend yield when their yields are 1 percent, 2 percent, or 3 percent. 
> The point is that each stock has established its own profile of value, its own individual parameters of dividend yield, and each stock must be evaluated individually.
 

## Stock Investing
When an investor buys shares of stock, he buys part ownership of a corporation. 
The return on a stock investment comes in two forms: 
1. Capital appreciation (an increase in share price) and dividends, which we will discuss in greater detail shortly. 
2. Unlike a fixed-income investment, common stocks pay no fixed rate of interest and offer no guarantees for the return of capital.
